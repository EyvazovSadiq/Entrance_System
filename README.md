# Entrance_System

The Room Entrance System application is created for a university. You can use it for each room inside of the university.

## How it works

At the university, there are many groups of students, and they have different course schedule. Hence, each group uses the classrooms at different times during the day. 

If a student wants to enter the room, he writes his username and password. The tool authenticates the student, if he is the student of this university and he has a lesson in this room in the current time, the student is allowed to enter the room. Otherwise, a warning message appears on the screen.
